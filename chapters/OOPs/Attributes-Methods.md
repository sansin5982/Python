### Attributes and methods

#### Attributes: The Properties (Data)
Think of attributes as the **characteristics or features** of a specific house.

For example:
* Number of bedrooms = 3
* Color = Blue
* Has a garden = Yes
* Area = 1200 square feet

These are the **data stored inside the object**.
Every house (object) can have **different values** for these attributes.

> In programming, attributes are like variables that belong to the object.

#### Methods: The Actions (Behaviors)
Now, think of what a house **can do** (or what people can do inside the house):
* Open the door
* Turn on the lights
* Lock the gate
* Water the plants

These are **methods** — the **functions** or actions that the house can perform.

> In programming, methods are like functions that belong to the object.


#### Analogy

| Concept   | House Analogy Example                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Class     | House blueprint                                  |
| Object    | Actual house built from the blueprint            |
| Attribute | Number of rooms, color, area (stored properties) |
| Method    | Open door, turn on lights (actions it can do)    |

### Simple Real-World Analogy (Person)
Let’s take a **person** this time:
* Class = The idea of a "Person"
* Object = You or me — a real person
* Attributes = Name, age, height
* Methods = Speak, walk, eat
