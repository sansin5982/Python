## Introduction to Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Python provides built-in functions, and users can create their own custom functions to improve code reusability and readability. Functions can be of multiple types:
* Built-in Functions
* User defined Functions
* Recursive Function
* Lambda Function
* Higher-Order Functions

## Advantage of Functions in Python

These are the following advantages of Python functions.

- Using functions, we can avoid rewriting the same logic/code again and again in a program.
- We can call Python functions multiple times in a program and anywhere in a program.
- We can track a large Python program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
- Reusability is the main achievement of Python functions.
- However, Function calling is always overhead in a Python program.
